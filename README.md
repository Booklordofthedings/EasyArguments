# EasyArguments
A simple file that adds a fast and easy way to read to work with arguments in the beef programming language


Simply just add the args[] into the FormatArgs() Function and then you can get the command member or
get individualy supplied values via Get[Value].

This works for Strings, Ints, Floats and Bools so far.
